# Spell-Checker
You, as a member of a development team for a new spell checking program, are to write a module that will check the correctness of given words using a known dictionary of all correct words in all their forms. If the word is absent in the dictionary then it can be replaced by correct words (from the dictionary) that can be obtained by one of the following operations: ?deleting of one letter from the word; ?replacing of one letter in the word with an arbitrary letter; ?inserting of one arbitrary letter into the word. Your task is to write the program that will find all possible replacements from the dictionary for every given word.
